REQUIREMENTS:
Python 3.7.6 64-bit ('base': conda) works best in this version
Installing Anaconda would be preferred, since without it, you have to install some packages.

HOW TO USE:
Step 1: Download this whole "complex_analysis" repository, and extract it.
Step 2: Open the main.py file to start the program, a GUI will pop up.
Step 3: Fill in the following fields:
	Type of set ("Julia" or "Mandelbrot")
	Upper and lower bounds for real and imaginary axes
	Scale (Numbers > 1 are for magnification, and numbers < 1 are for shrinking)
	DPI: Number of pixels per inch
	Maximum number of iterations the program is going to perform
	Constant (written in complex form: a + bj) if the set is a Julia set
Step 4: Hit Enter and wait for the image to pop up.
